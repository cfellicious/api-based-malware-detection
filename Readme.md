# Order invariant API based malware detection
This repository contains the code and supplementary information for the Order invariant API based malware detection.
We base this repository on a, soon to be publicly available, dataset that traced the API calls to ntdll.dll in Windows.
The file Traced_Functions.md contains the names of the traced functions.
The shas_by_families.json contains the names of the files and the malware family that it belongs to as well.

# Dataset
The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/11079764
